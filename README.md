# mastermind

This is a simple mistermind CLI game that I coded as an exercise for [The Odin Project](theodinproject.com) curriculum to understand better how to code with classes and objects. I had a lot of fun coding it and it is my favourite game I coded to date :))

It is not perfect at all and the code is quite messy, but for a first draft is good enough


## Things learned with the latest added feature
- OOP is incredibly modular and maintainable and you can change a lot of features and app flow by changing less than a few lines of code


## Things to fix

- [ ] Refactor code so I don't have to edit stuff in 1000 different places to add, change or remove a current program behaviour (no example coming to mind right now)
- [ ] Show better and more comprehensive instructions and game feedback (available colors, game rules and so on)
- [x] Add option to choose the available colors from game class
- [ ] Add option to choose the available colors and rounds from CLI
- [x] Add option to play as puzzler against ai
- [ ] Add option to play as the puzzler against AI (I still have to find a reliable game strategy)
- [ ] refactor code and review naming conventions across the project (user vs player, choices vs available vs selected, and others are used interchangeably and this creates a very confusing developing experience)
