# mastermind

This is a simple mistermind CLI game that I coded as an exercise for [The Odin Project](theodinproject.com) curriculum to understand better how to code with classes and objects. I had a lot of fun coding it and it is my favourite game I coded to date :))

It is not perfect at all and the code is quite messy, but for a first draft is good enough



## Things to fix

- Refactor code so I don't have to edit stuff in 1000 different places to add, change or remove a current program behaviour (no example coming to mind right now)
- Show better and more comprehensive instructions and game feedback (available colors, game rules and so on)
- Add option to choose the available colors and rounds from code and later from CLI
- Add option to play as the puzzler against AI (I still have to find a reliable game strategy)
