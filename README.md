# Mastermind CLI Game

A command-line implementation of the classic Mastermind game, developed as part of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com) curriculum. This project served as an exercise in understanding Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles, specifically focusing on the use of classes and objects.

## Introduction
The Mastermind CLI game is a simple yet engaging game where players attempt to guess a secret code generated by the computer. This project was particularly enjoyable to code and remains one of my favorite coding exercises to date. While the code is functional, it is still a work in progress and may require further refinement.

## Key Learnings
Working on this project solidified my understanding of OOP principles. One of the key takeaways was the realization of how modular and maintainable OOP can be. With just a few changes, you can significantly alter features and the overall flow of the application.

## Installation
To play the Mastermind CLI game, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/edoardodepiccoli/mastermind.git
   cd mastermind
   ```

2. **Run the Game:**
   Ensure that you have Ruby installed on your system, then run the game with:
   ```bash
   ruby main.rb
   ```

## Usage
Once the game starts, follow the on-screen prompts to play. You'll be guessing a secret code within a set number of rounds. The game will provide feedback on your guesses to help you deduce the correct code.

### Game Modes
- **Player vs. Computer:** The computer generates a code, and you attempt to guess it.
- **Player as Puzzler:** You create the code, and the AI tries to guess it.

## Known Issues & Planned Improvements
While the game is functional, there are several areas identified for improvement:

- **Code Refactoring:**
  - [ ] Refactor the codebase to improve maintainability, reducing the need to edit multiple parts of the code for a single change.

- **User Experience Enhancements:**
  - [ ] Improve the clarity of game instructions and feedback (e.g., available colors, game rules).
  - [ ] Add a CLI option for users to select available colors and the number of rounds.
  - [x] Allow color selection directly from the game class.
  - [x] Add an option to play as the puzzler against an AI opponent.
  - [ ] Further develop AI strategy for guessing when the player is the puzzler.

- **Code Consistency:**
  - [ ] Review and standardize naming conventions across the project (e.g., "user" vs. "player," "choices" vs. "available" vs. "selected").
